# HealthWellnessToken
# Message System
This Solidity code creates a token contract named HealthWellnessToken for tracking health activities. Users can log activities like calories burned and steps taken to earn tokens. These tokens can later be redeemed for services. The contract ensures users can't earn tokens unless they meet specific activity criteria. It also records each user's activities for reference.

# Description
This code creates a system where people can earn digital tokens, like points, for doing healthy activities such as burning calories or taking steps. These tokens are stored on a digital ledger called a blockchain. Users earn tokens based on how much they exerciseâ€”for example, more tokens for burning more calories or taking more steps.
Once they earn tokens, users can spend them to get services or rewards related to health and wellness. The code also keeps a record of each person's activities, like when they exercised and how much they did, so it's all transparent and can't be changed later. Overall, it's a way to encourage people to stay healthy by rewarding their efforts with tokens they can use later.
